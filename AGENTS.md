# Repository Guidelines

## Early-release contract

Prioritize correctness and strict, uniform project contracts over compatibility.
Remove deprecated APIs, old-syntax aliases, and obsolete server fallbacks when
replacing a contract. Document breaking changes and concrete migration steps.
Label ownership and sanitization are keyed by exact fully qualified resource type
and attribute, declared by validated `LabelTarget` values; no global or wildcard
applicability adapters are supported.

## Project Overview

`treetop-core` is a Rust library that turns Cedar policies and application-owned
request data into authorization decisions. Treat authorization behavior, public
Rust types, serialized shapes, and policy diagnostics as security-sensitive API
surface.

The crate supports optional Cedar schema validation, atomic policy and labeler
reloads, candidate-policy listing, observability sinks, snapshots, Criterion
benchmarks, and Gungraun/Callgrind benchmarks.

## Verification

- Run formatting with `cargo fmt --all --check`.
- Run strict linting across every target and feature combination with
  `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
- Run the full test and doctest suite with
  `cargo test --locked --all-features`.
- When snapshots are affected, install `cargo-insta` and run
  `cargo insta test --all-features --unreferenced reject -- -q`. Review changed
  snapshots; do not accept them blindly.
- Check documentation with
  `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --locked --all-features --no-deps`.
- Lint Markdown with
  `npx markdownlint-cli2 --config .markdownlint.json "**/*.md" "!target"`.
- Audit locked dependencies with `cargo audit`. Investigate transitive and
  development-only findings instead of suppressing them without a written
  rationale.
- For manifest, release, or package-boundary changes, inspect the exact crate
  contents with `cargo package --locked --list` and finish with
  `cargo publish --locked --dry-run`.
- Prefer the full suite once more than a few targeted tests are relevant. Use a
  targeted test while iterating, then run the full checks before completion.

## Architecture

- `src/engine.rs` owns the authorization hot path. An immutable `EngineState`
  holds policies, schema/store layout, labelers, and version as one atomic
  generation. One evaluation must use one state from request preparation
  through its returned decision; `EvaluationSession` freezes that state for a
  batch.
- `src/loader.rs` parses and schema-validates policies and precomputes metadata.
  Build a complete replacement snapshot before publishing it.
- `src/types/` contains the public request, identity, context, decision, and
  policy-listing types. Serde and Utoipa representations are public API.
- `src/labels.rs` derives server-controlled resource attributes. Labelers get
  an immutable resource and derive one declared output; the controlled
  `LabelerApply::apply` operation owns replacement/removal. Labelers run in
  insertion order and are part of the authorization trust boundary.
- `src/query.rs` and `src/policy_match.rs` perform structural matching for
  policy-listing APIs. They do not execute Cedar conditions.
- `src/metrics.rs` is feature-gated observability infrastructure. Sink callbacks
  execute synchronously in the evaluation path.
- `benches/` and `docs/Perf.md` define the performance baseline. Keep benchmark
  declarations in `Cargo.toml` and the matrix in `.github/workflows/perf.yml` in
  sync.
- `build.rs` and `src/build_info.rs` provide build metadata. Keep builds
  deterministic where possible and avoid adding build-time work casually.

## Authorization And Security Invariants

- `PolicyEngine::evaluate*` is the authorization source of truth. Policy-listing
  methods only match static principal, action, resource, and effect constraints;
  they do not evaluate `when` or `unless` clauses, and an `Any` effect filter can
  include forbids. Never use `PolicyCandidates`, `candidate_actions()`, or
  listing results as proof that an operation is allowed.
- Fail closed. Callers must not turn `PolicyError`, parse failures, schema
  failures, missing data, or observability failures into an allow decision.
- Preserve schema validation across normal reloads. Policy and schema
  replacements must validate fully before the atomic swap; a failed reload must
  leave the prior snapshot active.
- Treat principal identities, group membership, resource attributes, and request
  context as trusted application inputs. Do not pass client-asserted group
  membership or derived authorization labels through unchecked.
- A labeler's output must not be forgeable through preexisting untrusted
  attributes. Keep labeler implementations read-only; the blanket apply
  operation must replace or remove the owned output. Retain receiver-style
  `labeler.apply(&mut resource)` through `LabelerApply`; do not replace it with
  a free function or let implementations override mutation. Reject reserved or
  duplicate output ownership and test empty, conflicting, and repeated
  applications.
- Prefer Cedar's typed parsers and validating constructors over hand-built
  entity strings. Reject malformed or empty IDs, invalid namespaces, malformed
  group suffixes, invalid IP values, and schema-incompatible attributes at the
  boundary.
- Keep evaluation code panic-free. Return a specific `PolicyError` for malformed
  or adversarial inputs; reserve `unwrap`, `expect`, and `panic!` for tests and
  provable build-time invariants.
- Do not log full policy text, context, resource attributes, or other secrets.
  Principal and resource identifiers may be personal or sensitive data; redact
  or hash them where appropriate.
- Metrics labels must have bounded cardinality and valid backend escaping. Raw
  user IDs, resource IDs, or attacker-controlled policy annotations are unsafe
  default labels.
- Expose forbid diagnostics only where the caller is allowed to learn policy
  structure. Diagnostics explain a decision; they must never change it.

## Type-Encoded Invariants

- Follow a define, enforce, consume pattern. Define the valid state in a type,
  enforce it once at an input or reload boundary, then let internal consumers
  rely on the type instead of rechecking strings, options, or indexes.
- Give validated types private fields and fallible constructors. Manual
  `Deserialize` implementations must call the same constructor so Serde cannot
  bypass validation. Keep unchecked helpers crate-private and narrowly scoped
  to already-proven data.
- Model distinct capabilities or states as distinct types. Use marker types,
  sealed traits, proof tokens, and dedicated structs when they make invalid
  transitions or combinations fail to compile. Do not represent a required
  value as `Option`, a validated index as a bare integer, or mutually exclusive
  states as loosely related booleans.
- Separate trusted results from wire data. Authorization-bearing types such as
  `Decision` must be constructible only by the evaluator and must not implement
  `Deserialize`. Use explicitly non-authoritative DTOs for persisted or
  client-supplied decision-shaped data.
- Treat atomic publication as a type boundary. Build a complete immutable
  replacement state, including every component that can affect a decision,
  before one swap. A session or prepared proof must retain that exact state
  until evaluation and version reporting finish.
- Remove fallibility after validation. Functions consuming validated identities
  should return plain values unless a genuinely new failure can occur. Prefer a
  private proof type over repeatedly matching impossible enum/option cases.
- Add compile-fail doctests for forbidden state transitions and runtime tests
  for every validating constructor and deserializer. Test that old sessions
  remain coherent across successful and failed reloads.
- Type safety must move work out of the hot path, not add work to it. Cache or
  precompute validated Cedar forms at construction/reload time, keep proof and
  marker types zero-sized, avoid per-evaluation reparsing or allocation, and
  compare the relevant Criterion and Gungraun baselines for changes to type
  layout, cloning, state capture, or request preparation.

## Performance

- Treat `PolicyEngine::prepare`, entity construction, authorization, decision
  construction, and metrics dispatch as hot paths.
- Avoid reparsing entity UIDs, cloning a complete `Resource`, allocating
  temporary collections, or deep-cloning policy JSON and literals per
  evaluation unless a benchmark demonstrates the tradeoff is acceptable.
- Keep snapshots immutable and reads lock-free. Do not introduce a global mutex,
  blocking I/O, or policy compilation into evaluation.
- Labelers should be fast, deterministic, and side-effect-free. Their controlled
  apply operation must be idempotent. Compile regular expressions and other
  matchers once, outside evaluation.
- Metrics sinks run synchronously. They must not block, perform network I/O, or
  retain an unbounded event history. Prefer atomics, bounded channels, and
  fixed-cardinality aggregates.
- Phase measurements must be non-overlapping if they are summed. If phases are
  nested, document that fact and do not double-count them as overhead.
- Add focused Criterion benchmarks for wall-clock trends and Gungraun
  benchmarks for deterministic instruction-level trends. Keep benchmark
  fixtures stable and representative of production request shapes. The legacy
  `iai` Cargo target names are intentional: v3 uses them to pair historical
  IAI-Callgrind results with Gungraun results.
- For a performance-sensitive change, compare the relevant baseline and feature
  sets described in `docs/Perf.md`; do not infer improvement from code shape
  alone.

## Rust And Public API Standards

- Follow idiomatic Rust and let `rustfmt` own formatting. Prefer clear code over
  clever iterator chains in security-sensitive paths.
- Keep invalid states out of public types where practical. Use private fields,
  validating constructors, and explicit accessors; use `Result` when validation
  can fail.
- Be deliberate about SemVer. Adding a variant to an exhaustively matchable
  public enum is breaking unless the type is already `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- Keep public errors actionable and preserve their source when practical. Remove
  obsolete lock/error variants only as an intentional API change.
- Public types and methods need useful rustdoc, including security semantics and
  error behavior. Update doctests when examples change.
- Keep Serde and Utoipa definitions aligned. Snapshot intentional JSON changes
  and call them out as API changes.
- Prefer standard-library operations over a new dependency for small tasks. Put
  test-only tooling in `[dev-dependencies]`, remove unused direct dependencies,
  and explain new runtime or build dependencies.
- Use `#[cfg(test)]` for test modules and feature gates for optional runtime
  behavior. Check default features as well as `--all-features` when changing
  conditional compilation.
- Avoid broad `#[allow(...)]` attributes. Scope a necessary exception narrowly
  and explain the invariant that makes it safe.

## Tests And Snapshots

- Add regression tests for every authorization bug. Include the expected allow,
  deny, or error outcome and the relevant diagnostics/version behavior.
- Cover permit and forbid precedence, groups, namespaces, request context,
  schema validation, failed reload rollback, and concurrent reload/evaluation
  behavior when those paths change.
- For parsing changes, test malformed delimiters, quotes, escapes, empty values,
  namespaced resources, and round trips through Cedar and Serde.
- Keep each test focused on one behavior. Parameterize input variants when the
  assertion is the same.
- Snapshot tests supplement semantic assertions; they do not replace them.
  Review snapshots for accidental policy text, IDs, timestamps, or unstable
  ordering.
- Tests share global tracing and metrics state in places. Use existing serial
  test patterns when mutating a global sink or subscriber, and always restore or
  replace global state deterministically.

## Observability

- The `observability` feature must not change an authorization decision.
- Keep the disabled feature path cheap and ensure the enabled path is measured.
- Dispatch one evaluation event consistently to one sink snapshot. Avoid loading
  a replaceable global sink separately for logically related callbacks.
- Bound, redact, and escape exported dimensions. Examples must demonstrate
  production-safe cardinality and memory behavior rather than only small test
  inputs.
- Keep timing field names and units stable. Update `docs/Metrics.md`, examples,
  integration tests, and benchmarks together when the contract changes.

## Dependencies, CI, And Releases

- Keep `Cargo.lock` committed and use `--locked` in CI and release verification.
- Configure Dependabot for both Cargo and GitHub Actions. Review dependency
  updates for MSRV, feature, license, security, compile-time, and binary-size
  impact.
- Pin third-party GitHub Actions and reusable workflows to reviewed commit SHAs.
  Keep workflow permissions minimal, especially for pull-request jobs.
- CI must enforce formatting, strict all-target Clippy, all-feature tests,
  snapshot hygiene, documentation, and dependency auditing rather than merely
  printing warnings.
- Keep the packaged crate intentionally small with `include` or `exclude` rules.
  Never publish editor settings, agent settings, secrets, CI-only fixtures, or
  benchmark artifacts accidentally.
- Follow `RELEASING.md`: update `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, add a dated entry to
  `Changelog.md`, merge to `main`, then tag that exact commit as `vX.Y.Z`.
- Treat the changelog review as required for every user-visible behavior,
  security, performance, public API, or serialized-shape change. Explicitly
  document breaking changes and caller migration steps.

## Change Discipline

- Merge pull requests into `main` with a squash merge rather than a merge commit
  or rebase merge.
- Use the detailed pull request description as the squash commit body. Preserve
  its substantive summary, rationale, behavior notes, breaking-change and
  migration guidance, and issue references, but remove verification-only
  sections such as test commands and checklists before merging.
- Keep edits scoped and preserve unrelated user changes in a dirty worktree.
- Read the surrounding implementation, tests, docs, and benchmarks before
  changing authorization behavior.
- Add or update tests with behavior changes. Add a benchmark when a hot-path
  regression would otherwise be easy to miss.
- Do not weaken checks, delete snapshots, suppress advisories, or widen trust
  boundaries merely to make CI pass.
- Record assumptions and unresolved security or performance tradeoffs in the
  change description so reviewers can evaluate them explicitly.
